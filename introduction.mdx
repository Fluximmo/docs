An expert in real estate data since 2017, Fluximmo aggregates, utilizes, enriches, and analyzes the French real estate market in real-time to offer data streams, APIs, widgets, as well as expertise in real estate estimation.

At Fluximmo, our goal is to establish Fluximmo as a pioneer platform for real estate data. We prioritize ensuring that the accessibility to our APIs is maximized through comprehensive and transparent documentation.
However, it's important to note that our journey with Fluximmo is a continuous evolution. If you encounter any challenges or need additional clarification, we encourage you to send us a mail or book a call to connect with a member of our team.

By harnessing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, Fluximmo sets itself apart by employing machine learning and predictive analysis to extract insightful patterns and trends from collected data.

These refined analyses provide critical information, enabling real estate professionals to make informed decisions, create accurate estimation reports, anticipate market fluctuations, and, most importantly, personalize their services to cater to the unique needs of their clients.

This ability to translate data into actionable insights offers a significant competitive edge and opens new avenues for strategic development and success in the real estate sector.
